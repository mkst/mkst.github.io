# Hello World

```q
q)"Hello World"
"Hello World"
```

After completing the 2017 [AdventOfCode](http://adventofcode.com/) challenges using [q/kdb+](http://www.kx.com), I decided that I would revisit my solutions and write them up as blog posts in the hope that someone may find them useful.

Each post will detail parts 1 and 2 of the challenge, I'll aim to explain my thought process, building up each solution piece-by-piece.

All solutions are available in my [AoC Github repository](https://github.com/streetster/aoc).
