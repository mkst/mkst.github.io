# Day 0 - Firing up our first q/kdb+ session

Getting started with q/kdb+ isn't *quite* as straightforward as simply downloading the binary file and double-clicking. You can read through the *official* getting started guide on the [Kx Wiki](https://code.kx.com/q/learn/install/), or you can follow the steps below.

 - [Linux Instructions](#linux-instructions)
 - [Windows Instructions](#windows-instructions)
 - Mac instructions will follow later...

**Note:** I am assuming that you are using the *free* 32bit version. If you are using the 64bit version, follow the instructions provided by Kx which will explain about the `k4.lic` or `kc.lic` license files.

## Linux Instructions

Firstly download the `Linux-x86` zip from [kx.com/download/](https://kx.com/download/).

The following assumes we downloaded the zip to `~/Downloads/linuxx86.zip` and want all our code to live in `~/kdb`

```sh
$ cd # change directory to /home/username
$ mkdir -p kdb && cd kdb # create ~/kdb directory and enter it
$ unzip ~/Downloads/linuxx86.zip # extract the zip into the current directory
Archive:  linuxx86.zip
  inflating: q/README.txt
  inflating: q/l32/q
  inflating: q/q.q
  inflating: q/q.k
  inflating: q/s.k
  inflating: q/trade.q
  inflating: q/sp.q
```

Install `rlwrap` if it is not already present:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install rlwrap # debian
$ sudo yum install rlwrap     # redhat
$ sudo pacman -S rlwrap       # arch
```

Unless you're running a 32bit version of Linux, you'll likely need to install the `libc` 32bit libraries:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 # debian
$ sudo yum install glibc.i686     # redhat
```

Now let's create a script to setup our environment, note that this just contains the basics, but we can extend as required later.

```sh
$ mkdir scripts
$ cat > scripts/env.sh << \EOF
BASE=$(readlink -f $(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/..)
export QHOME=${BASE}/q
export PATH=${PATH}:${QHOME}
EOF
```

Now setup a shortcut from `q32` to the `q` binary and set the executable flag

```sh
$ echo "rlwrap -r \${QHOME}/l32/q $* -c 80 240" > q/q32
$ chmod +x q/q32
```

Now we can `source` our `env.sh` file and then start up a `q32` session

```sh
$ source scripts/env.sh
$ q32

```

## Windows Instructions

Firstly download the `Windows` zip from [kx.com/download/](http://kx.com/download/).

The following assumes we downloaded the zip to `C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\windows.zip` and want all our code to live in `C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\kdb`

Right-click the `windows.zip` file and extract to `C:\Users\<Username>\kdb`. It will create a folder called `q` which will contain the Q binary and a few scripts.

Now let's create a script to setup our environment, we want to create a folder inside the `kdb` directory called `scripts`. Once done, fire up your favourite text editor, paste the following snippet in, and save as `env.bat` inside the `scripts` directory.

```posh
:: disable echoing to console
@echo off
:: save current directory
set cwd=%cd%
:: change to q directory
cd /d %~dp0../q
:: setup Q environment variables
set QHOME=%cd%
:: add QHOME to our path
set PATH=%PATH%;%QHOME%
:: return to where originated
cd /d %cwd%
```

We also want to create a shortcut for our Q binary. Save the following snippet to a file called `q32.cmd` inside the `q` directory that was created when you unzipped the `windows.zip` file

```batch
%QHOME%\w32\q
```

We can then fire up the command prompt (Start -> Run -> `cmd.exe`), load our environment script and run `q32.cmd`
