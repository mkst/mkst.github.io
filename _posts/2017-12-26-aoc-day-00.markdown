# Day 0 - Firing up our first q/kdb+ session

Getting started with q/kdb+ isn't quite as straightforward as simply downloading the binary file and double-clicking. You can read through the *official* getting started guide on the [KX Wiki](http://code.kx.com/q/tutorials/install/), or you can follow the steps below.

**Note:** Windows and Mac instructions will follow later...

## Linux

Firstly download the `Linux-x86` zip from [kx.com/download/](http://kx.com/download/).

The following assumes we downloaded the zip to `~/Downloads/linuxx86.zip` and want all our code to live in `~/kdb`

```sh
$ cd # change directory to /home/username
$ mkdir -p kdb && cd kdb # create ~/kdb directory and enter it
$ unzip ~/Downloads/linuxx86.zip # extract the zip into the current directory
Archive:  linuxx86.zip
  inflating: q/README.txt
  inflating: q/l32/q
  inflating: q/q.q
  inflating: q/q.k
  inflating: q/s.k
  inflating: q/trade.q
  inflating: q/sp.q
```

Install `rlwrap` if it is not already present:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install rlwrap # debian
$ sudo yum install rlwrap # redhat
$ sudo pacman -S rlwrap # arch
```

Unless you're running a 32bit version of Linux, you'll likely need to install the `libc` 32bit libraries:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libc-i386 # debian
$ sudo yum install glibc.i686 # redhat
```

Now let's create a script to setup our environment, note that this just contains the basics, but we can extend as required later.

```sh
$ mkdir scripts
$ cat > scripts/env.sh << \EOF
BASE=$(readlink -f $(cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"  )"/.. && pwd))
export QHOME=${BASE}/q
export PATH=${PATH}:${QHOME}
EOF
```

Now setup a shortcut from `q32` to the `q` binary and set the executable flag

```sh
$ echo "rlwrap -r \${QHOME}/l32/q $* -c 80 240" > q/q32
$ chmod +x q/q32
```

Now we can `source` our `env.sh` file and then start up a `q32` session

```sh
$ source scripts/env.sh
$ q32
