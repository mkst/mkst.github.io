# Hello and welcome!

After completing the 2017 AdventOfCode challenges using [q/kdb+](http://www.kx.com), I decided that I would revisit my solutions and write them up as blog posts in the hope that someone may find them useful.

Each post will detail parts 1 and 2 of the challenge, I'll aim to explain my thought process, building up each solution piece-by-piece.
