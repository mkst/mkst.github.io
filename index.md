# Hello, World!

```q

Hello, World!
```

After completing the 2017 [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges using [q/kdb+](https://www.kx.com), I decided that I would revisit my solutions and write them up as blog posts in the hope that someone may find them useful.

Each post will detail parts 1 and 2 of the day's challenge. I'll explain my thought process, building up each solution piece-by-piece.

My intention is for this to be accessible to people who may have some prior programming experience, but are new to Q.

All solutions are available in my [AoC Github repository](https://github.com/streetster/aoc).
